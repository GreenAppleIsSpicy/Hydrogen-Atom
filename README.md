# Hydrogen-Atom

Allows you to visualize the orbitals in the Hydrogen Atom in 2D or in 3D as a pointcloud which can be exported as a .PLY file and opened in programs like Blender to be rendered.
You will need to have an extra file, '\Electron_Orbitals\' in the same directory as the python file is running, it will be the saving location for your PLYs.
You will need:
- Numpy
- Math
- Matplotlib
- Open3D
